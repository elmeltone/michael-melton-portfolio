Thinkful Portfolio

For this project, I was required to use previous Thinkful coding projects to create a responsive portfolio site. Here are the detailed requirements:

Portfolio Requirements:
Your project must:

Use Semantic HTML
Implement at least 2 well-designed fonts (see Thinkful mentor, Phoebe Espiritu's exampled of well paired Google Fonts)
Have a consistent color pattern (Try Paleton or Google's Material Design Spec for some inspiration)
Prominently identify yourself as a "Web Developer"
Display an overview text ( it can come from your "About Me" page)
A section titled "Projects" with screenshots of your NY Times hack, Karma landing page clone, and "About Me" pages
Each of the coded project screenshots should be a link to the code
Be fully responsive
Use CSS grids
